--Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project is one where users can take driving lessons to help them pass their driving exam. It was designed with different levels of packages available to the user. DriverPass allows users to schedule online lessons and live driving practices, aiming to be a one-stop solution for people seeking to obtain their driver's license.

--What did you do particularly well?
I was able to provide a clear and understandable concept layout of the program in the UML diagrams. Other layouts can sometimes be difficult to follow and comprehend, but I believe my layout addresses these issues effectively.

--If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would opt to rework my login UML diagram. I overlooked some key features, such as the lockout mechanism after multiple failed attempts, which others seemed to incorporate effectively. Also, upon revising my class diagram, I realized I had missed some variables that I overlooked during my initial double-check.

--How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
My process of implementing a user's needs began with understanding their expectations from the system. This involved reading transcripts and interpreting their requirements. I compiled a list of key features they wanted and another list of elements needed to realize those features. Users often request certain functionalities without fully understanding the system's perspective, hence the importance of the second list. I break down each key point into simple functions, identifying the necessary variables for each. This tree-like structure helps outline the program's framework. Remember, designers should focus on the user's needs, as the user and designer may not always share the same interests.

--How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to designing software starts with understanding what the user wants from the system. For instance, in DriverPass, it began with the need to schedule appointments. I break down each component into its most basic functions and then identify the requirements for each function. This leads to a clear identification of the entire system and its sub-functions. From there, I delve into each function to determine the necessary variables and methods. My process involves creating a to-do list that outlines the basic functionalities of the program, evolving into a comprehensive project ready for deployment. This method of breaking down concepts into manageable pieces has proven effective in building a fully fleshed-out and deployable system.
